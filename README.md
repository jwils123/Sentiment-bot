# Thank you for checking out my twitter bot for sentiment analysis.
# I created this to show curious social scientist applications for sentiment analysis in their work.
# I learned how to make this application from Vincent Russo and FreeCodeCamp on YouTube; all credit goes to them. 
# To see FreeCodeCamp's version, paste this link in your browser https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gQ6uG5Ujiw&t=4820s.
# I had zero coding knowledge before going to their YouTube channel, if I can learn it, so can you. 
# For my slighlty modiefied twitter-bot, start with the Credentials file, and then proceed to the bot. Enjoy.
